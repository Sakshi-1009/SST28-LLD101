# SST28-LLD101 — SOLID Exercise Collection

Compact examples demonstrating SOLID principles and small LLD exercises.

Contents
- SOLID/: contains 10 short exercises (Ex1..Ex10). Each exercise has a `src/` folder with Java sources and a local `README.md` describing that exercise.

Quick start

Requirements
- Java 11 or newer

Build & run an exercise
1. Open a terminal and change to the exercise `src` directory, for example:

```bash
cd SOLID/Ex1/src
```

2. Compile and run the `Main` class:

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

Notes
- Each exercise is self-contained. Check the exercise README in `SOLID/Ex<N>/README.md` for specifics.
- The code is intentionally small and focused on design examples rather than production packaging.

Contributing
- Feel free to add improvements or additional exercises. Keep each exercise isolated under `SOLID/Ex<N>/`.

License
- See the repository `LICENSE` file.

Enjoy exploring the SOLID examples!
